# SDL-Space-Dodger-Game

This is a Space invader styled game in which the player needs to dodge objects.
The project was developed during my first year at university with SDL as part of an assignment, since then, I have learnt a lot about C++ development and intend to 
recreate this project with the new knowledge I have acquired.
